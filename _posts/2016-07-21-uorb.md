The micro Object Request Broker (uORB) application is used to share data structures between threads and applications.
Communications between processes / applications (e.g. sending sensor values from the sensors app to the attitude filter app) is a key part of the PX4 software architecture. Processes (often called nodes in this context) exchange messages over *named buses*, called **topics**(topics也可以叫做bus). 
To make this efficient, there is always *onlyone message on the bus and no queue is kept*.(一个topic里面只包含一中信息，并且不设置排队机制)
